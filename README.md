Overview

The Video File Age Checker tool scans a specified directory and its subdirectories for video files that are nearly a year old or older and are ready for archiving. It generates an “age report” listing these files and provides options to move them to a 'ready_to_archive' subdirectory for easy isolation and backing up.

Usage

Main Window

Upon launching the tool, the main window will appear with the following options:

Select Directory: Click this button to open a file dialog for selecting the directory you want to scan.

Check Age: Click this button to scan the selected directory for video files that are nearly a year old or older.

Save Directory Preference: Click this button to save the currently selected directory path to a preferences.txt file for future use.

Scan Results

After clicking "Check Age", a new window will appear with the following information:

Number of Files Found: The tool will display the number of files older than a year.

Open Report?: Clicking this button will open the generated age_report.txt in Notepad, listing the old files.

Move to Archive Folder?: Clicking this button will move the old files to a new subdirectory called 'ready_to_archive'.

Preferences

Clicking "Save Directory Preference" saves the current directory path to a preferences.txt file. This path will be automatically populated in the "Select Directory" field the next time you open the tool.
